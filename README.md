# College Meal Planner
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

### Problem:
As a college student, a problem I've experience and seen many others experience is meal planning. Students including myself often just pick a place to eat at a moment's notice
with no real concern for the cost, how healthy the option is, and whether or not it is making the most out of their probably very expensive meal plan. Students I've talked to
sometimes eat the same food every day and wish they had a better way to plan their meals.

### Solution:
The solution I had in mind had to be realistic for college students, so the experience of using my website should be quick and logical, as this is something the student should
just spend a few minutes a week doing. The solution should be as simple as a user picking the college they attend, choosing where they want to eat this week, and planning out how
many dining dollars and meal swipes they use. You might ask, how is this any different from just thinking about where you want to eat. Well when seeing your dining options/diet 
on "paper", the user should recognize some patterns in their choices. This could be as simple as, "wow, I never realized I ate at xyz dining court so much" or "I am only using 
half of my meal swipes every week, this could be something I could fix if I planned better". 
Planning out your dining options for the week is only half the battle, the user should adhere to their plan. This is why I choose to have a "Save as a PDF" option where the user is
prompted to the choice of saving their meal plan to their PC or even choose to print it out. 

#### Plan for the future:
I would love to add more colleges for the user to choose from and spread my website around college campuses. I want to learn more about icalendar so the user could export their plan
to an online calendar.
